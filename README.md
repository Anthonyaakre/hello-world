# hello-world
Just learning this stuff!
Didn't grow up with technology didn't seriously work with or have a computer of my own untill about 2008 and at that time it was just for word documents and the like for college.  I was a cogntive Science/Psychology/Philosophy major so didn't really use computers for anything besides reading articles and writing articles.  I could go on more about myself but....maybe later.
